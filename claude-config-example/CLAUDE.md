# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains configuration and documentation for Claude Code usage patterns and commit guidelines.

## Commit Message Standards

This repository follows strict conventional commit guidelines as defined in `commit-guidelines.md`. Key requirements:

- Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
- Subject line should complete: "If applied, this commit will..."
- Use present tense, imperative mood ("add", "fix", "update")
- Match verbosity to impact - small changes get concise messages, architectural changes get detailed explanations
- NEVER reference Claude, Claude Code, or AI assistance in commit messages
- Keep subject under 80 characters, wrap body at 100 characters

### Commit Types
- `feat`: new feature
- `fix`: bug fix
- `docs`: documentation changes
- `style`: formatting changes
- `refactor`: code changes that don't fix bugs or add features
- `test`: adding or updating tests
- `chore`: maintenance tasks, dependency updates

## Development Notes

This appears to be a reference/configuration repository rather than an active codebase with build processes or tests.
